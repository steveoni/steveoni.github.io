Hi, I'm Stephen Oni — a software engineer passionate about building scalable systems, developer tools, and open-source infrastructure.

I work across the stack, with a strong focus on backend engineering using Python and Go. My recent work explores systems programming (via Rust, C/C++), machine learning compilers, and performance-focused backend tools. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects that help developers be more productive and better understand the tools they use.

In my spare time, I’m likely exploring low-level systems, compilers, or hacking on side projects that challenge my understanding of how software works under the hood.

You can find some of my featured work on the [Projects page ](https://steveoni.github.io/project.html)or follow my journey on [GitHub](https://github.com/steveoni) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-oni).
